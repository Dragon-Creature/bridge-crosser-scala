# Bridge crosser scala
I created a simple ui to control the backend. It should work for both Desktop and Mobile. There is a lot more that can 
be added or improved on the frontend but due to time constraint I'm cutting it here.

Press the Add bridge to include a new bridge press the add Hiker inside a bride component to have a Hiker wait at that bride.

There is no way to remove a bride or Hiker. In case you want to remove something refresh the page and start over (sorry).
